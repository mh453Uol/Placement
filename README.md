# Placement
Web apps which I created whilst on placement

Whilst on placement I worked on a number of web applications these include CRMLive and IVD

## CRMLive
CRM and Quote management web app which can support multiple companies all under one website. 
Since this was a closed development project source code cant be disclosed. Here a video though - https://vimeo.com/200467905

### Features 
1. Register companies.
2. Add employees to companies.
3. Register organisation (conglomerate) and tie these to certain companies.
4. Create a quote for a company. 
5. Get a PDF version of a quote.
6. Fulfil a quote so reference batch numbers, courier details etc.
7. Create a visit report. 
8. Save documents - PDF, Word, Excel etc against visit report.
9. Add sample request. 
10. Add company feedback.
11. Complex searching/filtering functionality.
12. Notifications when certain actions occurs i.e when a quote is added, fulfilment team is notified.  

This web application was multi tenant, so 2 other companies were using this application. 

## IVD
