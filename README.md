# Placement
Web apps which I created whilst on placement

Whilst on placement I worked on a number of web applications these include CRMLive and IVD

## CRMLive
CRM and Quote management web app which can support multiple companies all under one website.

2. Add employees to companies.
3. Register organisation (conglomerate) and tie these to certain companies.
4. Create a quote for a company. 
5. Get a PDF version of a quote.
6. Fulfil a quote so reference batch numbers, courier details etc.
7. Create a visit report. 
8. Save documents - PDF, Word, Excel etc against visit report.
9. Add sample request. 
10. Add company feedback.
